# Troubleshoot trace nesting | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith

On this page

When tracing with the LangSmith SDK, LangGraph, and LangChain, tracing should automatically propagate the correct context so that code executed within a parent trace will be rendered in the expected location in the UI.

If you see a child run go to a separate trace (and appear on the top level), it may be caused by one of the following known "edge cases".

## Python​

The following outlines common causes for "split" traces when building with python.

### Context propagation using asyncio​

When using async calls (especially with streaming) in Python versions < 3.11, you may encounter issues with trace nesting. This is because Python's `asyncio` only [added full support for passing context](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.create_task) in version 3.11.

#### Why​

LangChain and LangSmith SDK use [contextvars](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html) to propagate tracing information implicitly. In Python 3.11 and above, this works seamlessly. However, in earlier versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10), `asyncio` tasks lack proper `contextvar` support, which can lead to disconnected traces.

#### To resolve​

  1. **Upgrade Python Version (Recommended)** If possible, upgrade to Python 3.11 or later for automatic context propagation.

  2. **Manual Context Propagation** If upgrading isn't an option, you'll need to manually propagate the tracing context. The method varies depending on your setup:

a) **Using LangGraph or LangChain** Pass the parent `config` to the child call:
         
         import asyncio  
         from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig, RunnableLambda  
           
         @RunnableLambda  
         async def my_child_runnable(  
                       inputs: str,  
                       # The config arg (present in parent_runnable below) is optional  
                       ):  
             yield "A"  
             yield "response"  
           
         @RunnableLambda  
         async def parent_runnable(inputs: str, config: RunnableConfig):  
             async for chunk in my_child_runnable.astream(inputs, config):  
                 yield chunk  
           
         async def main():  
             return [val async for val in parent_runnable.astream("call")]  
           
         asyncio.run(main())  
         

b) **Using LangSmith Directly** Pass the run tree directly:
         
         import asyncio  
         import langsmith as ls  
           
         @ls.traceable  
         async def my_child_function(inputs: str):  
             yield "A"  
             yield "response"  
           
         @ls.traceable  
         async def parent_function(  
                       inputs: str,  
                       # The run tree can be auto-populated by the decorator  
                       run_tree: ls.RunTree,  
                   ):  
             async for chunk in my_child_function(inputs, langsmith_extra={"parent": run_tree}):  
                 yield chunk  
           
         async def main():  
             return [val async for val in parent_function("call")]  
           
         asyncio.run(main())  
         

c) **Combining Decorated Code with LangGraph/LangChain** Use a combination of techniques for manual handoff:
         
         import asyncio  
         import langsmith as ls  
         from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig, RunnableLambda  
           
         @RunnableLambda  
         async def my_child_runnable(inputs: str):  
             yield "A"  
             yield "response"  
           
         @ls.traceable  
         async def my_child_function(inputs: str, run_tree: ls.RunTree):  
             with ls.tracing_context(parent=run_tree):  
                 async for chunk in my_child_runnable.astream(inputs):  
                     yield chunk  
           
         @RunnableLambda  
         async def parent_runnable(inputs: str, config: RunnableConfig):  
             # @traceable decorated functions can directly accept a RunnableConfig when passed in via "config"  
             async for chunk in my_child_function(inputs, langsmith_extra={"config": config}):  
                 yield chunk  
           
         @ls.traceable  
         async def parent_function(inputs: str, run_tree: ls.RunTree):  
             # You can set the tracing context manually  
             with ls.tracing_context(parent=run_tree):  
                 async for chunk in parent_runnable.astream(inputs):  
                     yield chunk  
           
         async def main():  
             return [val async for val in parent_function("call")]  
           
         asyncio.run(main())  
         

### Context propagation using threading​

It's common to start tracing and want to apply some parallelism on child tasks all within a single trace. Python's stdlib `ThreadPoolExecutor` by default breaks tracing.

#### Why​

Python's contextvars start empty within new threads. Here are two approaches to handle maintain trace contiguity:

#### To resolve​

  1. **Using LangSmith's ContextThreadPoolExecutor**

LangSmith provides a `ContextThreadPoolExecutor` that automatically handles context propagation:
         
         from langsmith.utils import ContextThreadPoolExecutor  
         from langsmith import traceable  
           
         @traceable  
         def outer_func():  
             with ContextThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:  
                 inputs = [1, 2]  
                 r = list(executor.map(inner_func, inputs))  
           
         @traceable  
         def inner_func(x):  
             print(x)  
           
         outer_func()  
         

  2. **Manually providing the parent run tree**

Alternatively, you can manually pass the parent run tree to the inner function:
         
         from langsmith import traceable, get_current_run_tree  
         from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  
           
         @traceable  
         def outer_func():  
             rt = get_current_run_tree()  
             with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:  
                 r = list(  
                     executor.map(  
                         lambda x: inner_func(x, langsmith_extra={"parent": rt}), [1, 2]  
                     )  
                 )  
           
         @traceable  
         def inner_func(x):  
             print(x)  
           
         outer_func()  
         

In this approach, we use `get_current_run_tree()` to obtain the current run tree and pass it to the inner function using the `langsmith_extra` parameter.

Both methods ensure that the inner function calls are correctly aggregated under the initial trace stack, even when executed in separate threads.
