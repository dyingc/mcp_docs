If you are interested in the [Enterprise](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) plan, please [contact sales](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales). This guide is only for our self-serve billing plans.

note

If you created your LangSmith organization before pricing was introduced on April 2nd, 2024, please skip to the final section.

To set up billing for your LangSmith organization, head to the [Usage and Billing](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/payments) page under Settings. Depending on your organization's settings, you will be given a different walkthrough to get started.

## Developer Plan: set up billing on your personal organization‚Äã

Personal organizations are limited to 5000 traces per month until a credit card is added. You can add a credit card on the Plans and Billing page as follows:

### 1\. Click `Set up Billing`‚Äã

### 2\. Add your credit card info‚Äã

After this step, you will no longer be rate limited to 5000 traces, and will be charged for any excess traces at rates specified on our [pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langsmith) page.

## Plus Plan: set up billing on a shared organization‚Äã

If you have not yet created an organization, please do so by following [this guide](/administration/how_to_guides/organization_management/set_up_organization). This walkthrough assumes you are already in a new organization.

note

New organizations are not usable until a credit card is entered. After you complete the following steps, you will gain complete access to LangSmith.
