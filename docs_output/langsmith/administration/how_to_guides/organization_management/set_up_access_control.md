note

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a feature that is only available to Enterprise customers. If you are interested in this feature, please contact our sales team at [sales@langchain.dev](mailto:sales@langchain.dev) Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.

LangSmith relies on RBAC to manage user permissions **within a workspace**. This allows you to control who can access your LangSmith workspace and what they can do within it. Only users with the `workspace:manage` permission can manage access control settings for a workspace.

## Create a role‚Äã

By default, LangSmith comes with a set of system roles:

  * `Admin` \- has full access to all resources within the workspace
  * `Viewer` \- has read-only access to all resources within the workspace
  * `Editor` \- has full permissions except for workspace management (adding/removing users, changing roles, configuring service keys)

If these do not fit your access model, Organization Admins can create custom roles to suit your needs.

To create a role, navigate to the `Roles` tab in the `Members and roles` section of the [Organization settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings). Note that new roles that you create will be usable across all workspaces within your organization.

Click on the `Create Role` button to create a new role. You should see a form like the one below:

Assign permissions for the different LangSmith resources that you want to control access to.

## Assign a role to a user‚Äã

Once you have your roles set up, you can assign them to users. To assign a role to a user, navigate to the `Workspace members` tab in the `Workspaces` section of the [Organization settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings)

Each user will have a `Role` dropdown that you can use to assign a role to them.

You can also invite new users with a given role.
