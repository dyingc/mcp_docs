# Prompt Canvas | ü¶úÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è LangSmith

On this page

The prompt canvas makes it easy to edit a prompt with the help of an LLM. This allows you to iterate faster on long prompts and also makes it easier to make overarching stylisting or tonal changes to your prompt. You can enter the promp canvas by clicking the glowing wand over any message in your prompt:

## Chat sidebar‚Äã

You can use the chat sidebar to ask questions about your prompt, or to give instructions in natural language to the LLM for how to rewrite your prompt.

Write Directly

You can also edit the prompt directly - you don't **need** to use the LLM. This is useful if you know what edits you want to make and just want to make them directly

## Quick actions‚Äã

There are quick actions to change the reading level or length of the prompt with a single mouse click:
