# Deleting Organizations | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith

On this page

The LangSmith UI does not currently support the deletion of an individual organization from a self-hosted instance of LangSmith. This, however, can be accomplished by directly removing all traces from all materialized views in ClickHouse (except the runs_history views) and the runs and feedbacks tables and then removing the Organization from the Postgres tenants table.

This command using the Organization ID as an argument.

### Prerequisites​

Ensure you have the following tools/items ready.

  1. kubectl

     * <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/>
  2. PostgreSQL client

     * <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>
  3. PostgreSQL database connection:

     * Host
     * Port
     * Username
       * If using the bundled version, this is `postgres`
     * Password
       * If using the bundled version, this is `postgres`
     * Database name
       * If using the bundled version, this is `postgres`
  4. Clickhouse database credentials

     * Host
     * Port
     * Username
       * If using the bundled version, this is `default`
     * Password
       * If using the bundled version, this is `password`
     * Database name
       * If using the bundled version, this is `default`
  5. Connectivity to the PostgreSQL database from the machine you will be running the migration script on.

     * If you are using the bundled version, you may need to port forward the postgresql service to your local machine.
     * Run `kubectl port-forward svc/langsmith-postgres 5432:5432` to port forward the postgresql service to your local machine.
  6. Connectivity to the Clickhouse database from the machine you will be running the migration script on.

     * If you are using the bundled version, you may need to port forward the clickhouse service to your local machine.
       * Run `kubectl port-forward svc/langsmith-clickhouse 8123:8123` to port forward the clickhouse service to your local machine.
     * If you are using Clickhouse Cloud you will want to specify the --ssl flag and use port `8443`
  7. The script to delete an organization

     * You can download the script from [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/scripts/delete_organization.sh)

### Running the deletion script for a single organization​

Run the following command to run the organization removal script:
    
    
    sh delete_organization.sh <postgres_url> <clickhouse_url> --organization_id <organization_id>  
    

For example, if you are using the bundled version with port-forwarding, the command would look like:
    
    
    sh delete_organization.sh "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres" "clickhouse://default:password@localhost:8123/default" --organization_id 4ec70ec7-0808-416a-b836-7100aeec934b  
    

If you visit the Langsmith UI, you should now see organization is no longer present.
