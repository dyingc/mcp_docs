# How to run an evaluation locally (Python only) | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith

On this page

Sometimes it is helpful to run an evaluation locally without uploading any results to LangSmith. For example, if you're quickly iterating on a prompt and want to smoke test it on a few examples, or if you're validating that your target and evaluator functions are defined correctly, you may not want to record these evaluations.

You can do this by using the LangSmith Python SDK and passing `upload_results=False` to `evaluate()` / `aevaluate()`.

This will run you application and evaluators exactly as it always does and return the same output, but nothing will be recorded to LangSmith. This includes not just the experiment results but also the application and evaluator traces.

## Example​

Let's take a look at an example:

  * Python

Requires `langsmith>=0.2.0`. Example also uses `pandas`.
    
    
    from langsmith import Client  
      
    # 1. Create and/or select your dataset  
    ls_client = Client()  
    dataset = ls_client.clone_public_dataset(  
        "https://smith.langchain.com/public/a63525f9-bdf2-4512-83e3-077dc9417f96/d"  
    )  
      
    # 2. Define an evaluator  
    def is_concise(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:  
        return len(outputs["answer"]) < (3 * len(reference_outputs["answer"]))  
      
    # 3. Define the interface to your app  
    def chatbot(inputs: dict) -> dict:  
        return {"answer": inputs["question"] + " is a good question. I don't know the answer."}  
      
    # 4. Run an evaluation  
    experiment = ls_client.evaluate(  
        chatbot,  
        data=dataset,  
        evaluators=[is_concise],  
        experiment_prefix="my-first-experiment",  
        # 'upload_results' is the relevant arg.  
        upload_results=False  
    )  
      
    # 5. Analyze results locally  
    results = list(experiment)  
      
    # Check if 'is_concise' returned False.  
    failed = [r for r in results if not r["evaluation_results"]["results"][0].score]  
      
    # Explore the failed inputs and outputs.  
    for r in failed:  
        print(r["example"].inputs)  
        print(r["run"].outputs)  
      
    # Explore the results as a Pandas DataFrame.  
    # Must have 'pandas' installed.  
    df = experiment.to_pandas()  
    df[["inputs.question", "outputs.answer", "reference.answer", "feedback.is_concise"]]  
    

  * Python

    
    
    {'question': 'What is the largest mammal?'}  
    {'answer': "What is the largest mammal? is a good question. I don't know the answer."}  
      
    {'question': 'What do mammals and birds have in common?'}  
    {'answer': "What do mammals and birds have in common? is a good question. I don't know the answer."}  
    

| inputs.question| outputs.answer| reference.answer| feedback.is_concise  
---|---|---|---|---  
0| What is the largest mammal?| What is the largest mammal? is a good question. I don't know the answer.| The blue whale| False  
1| What do mammals and birds have in common?| What do mammals and birds have in common? is a good question. I don't know the answer.| They are both warm-blooded| False
