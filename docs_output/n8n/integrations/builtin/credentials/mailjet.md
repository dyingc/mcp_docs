# Mailjet credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [Mailjet](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mailjet/)
  * [Mailjet Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mailjettrigger/)

## Prerequisites#

Create a [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods#

  * Email API key: For use with Mailjet's Email API
  * SMS token: For use with Mailjet's SMS API

## Related resources#

Refer to [Mailjet's Email API documentation](https://dev.mailjet.com/email/guides/) and [Mailjet's SMS API documentation](https://dev.mailjet.com/sms/guides/) for more information about each service.

## Using Email API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An **API Key** : View and generate API keys in your Mailjet [API Key Management](https://app.mailjet.com/account/api_keys) page.
  * A **Secret Key** : View your API Secret Keys in your Mailjet [API Key Management](https://app.mailjet.com/account/api_keys) page.
  * _Optional:_ Select whether to use **Sandbox Mode** for calls made using this credential. When turned on, all API calls use Sandbox mode: the API will still validate the payloads but won't deliver the actual messages. This can be useful to troubleshoot any payload error messages without actually sending messages. Refer to Mailjet's [Sandbox Mode documentation](https://dev.mailjet.com/email/guides/send-api-v31/#sandbox-mode) for more information.

For this credential, you can use either:

  * Mailjet's primary API key and secret key
  * A subaccount API key and secret key

Refer to Mailjet's [How to create a subaccount (or additional API key) documentation](https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042561974-How-to-create-a-subaccount-or-additional-API-Key) for detailed instructions on creating more API keys. Refer to [What are subaccounts and how does it help me?](https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042561854-What-are-subaccounts-and-how-does-it-help-me) page for more information on Mailjet subaccounts and when you might want to use one.

## Using SMS Token#

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * An access **Token** : Generate a new token from Mailjet's [SMS Dashboard](https://app.mailjet.com/sms). Refer to the [SMS API Getting Started guide](https://dev.mailjet.com/sms/guides/getting-started/) for more detailed instructions.
