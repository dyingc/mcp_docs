# RabbitMQ credentials#

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

  * [RabbitMQ](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmq/)
  * [RabbitMQ Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmqtrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods#

  * User connection

## Related resources#

Refer to [RabbitMQ's Connections documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/connections) for more information about the service.

## Using user connection#

To configure this credential, you'll need to have a [RabbitMQ broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) installed and:

  1. Enter the **Hostname** for the RabbitMQ broker.
  2. Enter the **Port** the connection should use.
  3. Enter a **User** the connection should use to log in as.
     * The default is `guest`. RabbitMQ recommends using a different user in production environments. Refer to [Access Control | The Basics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#basics) for more information. If you're using the `guest` account with a non-localhost connection, refer to `guest` user issues below for troubleshooting tips.
  4. Enter the user's **Password**.
     * The default password for the `guest` user is `guest`.
  5. Enter the [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts) the connection should use as the **Vhost**. The default virtual host is `/`.
  6. Select whether the connection should use **SSL**. If turned on, also set:
     * **Passwordless** : Select whether the SSL certificate connection users SASL mechanism EXTERNAL (turned off) or doesn't use a password (turned on). If turned on, you'll also need to enter:
       * The **Client Certificate** : Paste the text of the SSL client certificate to use.
       * The **Client Key** : Paste the SSL client key to use.
       * The **Passphrase** : Paste the SSL passphrase to use.
     * **CA Certificates** : Paste the text of the SSL CA certificates to use.

## guest user issues#

If you use the `guest` user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:
    
    
    1

| 
    
    
    [error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost
      
  
---|---  
  
This happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.

To resolve this error, you can:

  * Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.
  * Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.

Refer to ["guest" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users) for more information.
