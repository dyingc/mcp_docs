You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

## Supported authentication methods#

  * API key (Recommended)
  * Password

## Related resources#

Refer to [Odoo's External API documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/developer/reference/external_api.html) for more information about the service.

Refer to the Odoo [Getting Started tutorial](https://www.odoo.com/slides/getting-started-15) if you're new to Odoo.

## Using API key#

To configure this credential, you'll need a user account on an [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) database and:

  * Your **Site URL**
  * Your **Username**
  * An **API key**
  * Your **Database name**

To set up the credential with an API key:

  1. Enter your Odoo server or site URL as the **Site URL**.
  2. Enter your **Username** as it's displayed on your **Change password** screen in Odoo.
  3. To use an API key, go to **Your Profile > Preferences > Account Security > Developer API Keys**.
     * If you don't have this option, you may need to upgrade your Odoo plan. Refer to Required plan type for more information.
  4. Select **New API Key**.
  5. Enter a **Description** for the key, like `n8n integration`.
  6. Select **Generate Key**.
  7. Copy the key and enter it as the **Password or API key** in your n8n credential.
  8. Enter your Odoo **Database name** , also known as the instance name.

Refer to [Odoo API Keys](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/developer/reference/external_api.html?#api-keys) for more information.

## Using password#

To configure this credential, you'll need a user account on an [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) database and:

  * Your **Site URL**
  * Your **Username**
  * Your **Password**
  * Your **Database name**

To set up the credential with a password:

  1. Enter your Odoo server or site URL as the **Site URL**.
  2. Enter your **Username** as it's displayed on your **Change password** screen in Odoo.
  3. To use a password, enter your user password in the **Password or API key** field.
  4. Enter your Odoo **Database name** , also known as the instance name.

Password compatibility

If you try a password credential and it doesn't work for a specific node function, try switching to an API key. Odoo requires an API key for certain modules or based on certain settings.

## Required plan type#

Required plan type

Access to the external API is only available on a **Custom** Odoo plan. (The One App Free or Standard plans won't give you access.)

Refer to [Odoo Pricing Plans](https://www.odoo.com/pricing-plan) for more information.
