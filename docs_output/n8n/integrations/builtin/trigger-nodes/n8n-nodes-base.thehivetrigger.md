# TheHive Trigger node#

On this page, you'll find a list of events the TheHive Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

TheHive and TheHive 5

n8n provides two nodes for TheHive. Use this node (TheHive Trigger) if you want to use TheHive's version 3 or 4 API. If you want to use version 5, use [TheHive 5 Trigger](../n8n-nodes-base.thehive5trigger/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [TheHive Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/thehive-trigger/) page.
