## Waiting for a response#

By choosing the **Send and Wait for a Response** operation, you can send a message and pause the workflow execution until a person confirms the action or provides more information.

### Response Type#

You can choose between the following types of waiting and approval actions:

  * **Approval** : Users can approve or disapprove from within the message.
  * **Free Text** : Users can submit a response with a form.
  * **Custom Form** : Users can submit a response with a custom form.

You can customize the waiting and response behavior depending on which response type you choose. You can configure these options in any of the above response types:

  * **Limit Wait Time** : Whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specified time limit. This can be an interval or a specific wall time.
  * **Append n8n Attribution** : Whether to mention in the message that it was sent automatically with n8n (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Approval response customization#

When using the Approval response type, you can choose whether to present only an approval button or both approval _and_ disapproval buttons.

You can also customize the button labels for the buttons you include.

### Free Text response customization#

When using the Free Text response type, you can customize the message button label, the form title and description, and the response button label.

### Custom Form response customization#

When using the Custom Form response type, you build a form using the fields and options you want.

You can customize each form element with the settings outlined in the [n8n Form trigger's form elements](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/#form-elements). To add more fields, select the **Add Form Element** button.

You'll also be able to customize the message button label, the form title and description, and the response button label.
