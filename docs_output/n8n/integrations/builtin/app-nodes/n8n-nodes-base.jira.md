## What to do if your operation isn't supported#

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node: 

  1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
  2. Select the service you want to connect to.
  3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Related resources#

Refer to the [official JQL documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jql) about Jira Query Language (JQL) to learn more about it.

## Fetch issues for a specific project#

The **Get All** operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).

For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, you'd do something like this:

  * Select **Get All** from the **Operation** dropdown list.
  * Toggle **Return All** to true.
  * Select **Add Option** and select **JQL**.
  * Enter `project=n8n` in the **JQL** field.

This query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project.
