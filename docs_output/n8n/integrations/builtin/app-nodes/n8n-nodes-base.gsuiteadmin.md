## How to project a user's information#

There are three different ways to project a user's information:

  * **Basic** : Doesn't include any custom fields.
  * **Custom** : Includes the custom fields from schemas in `customField`.
  * **Full** : Include all the fields associated with the user.

To include custom fields, follow these steps:

  1. Select **Custom** from the **Projection** dropdown list.
  2. Select the **Add Options** button and select **Custom Schemas** from the dropdown list.
  3. Select the schema names you want to include from the **Custom Schemas** dropdown list.
