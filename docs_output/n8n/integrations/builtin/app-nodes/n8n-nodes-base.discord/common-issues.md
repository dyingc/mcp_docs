# Discord node common issues#

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Discord node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add extra fields to embeds#

Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more.

The Discord node supports embeds when using the **Send** operation on the **Message** resource. Select **Add Embeds** to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.

To add fields that aren't included by default, set **Input Method** to **Raw JSON**. From here, add a JSON object to the **Value** parameter defining the [field names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) and values you want to include.

For example, to include `footer` and `fields`, neither of which are available using the **Enter Fields** Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:
    
    
     1
     2
     3
     4

    {
        "author": "My Name",
    	"url": "https://discord.js.org",
    	"fields": [
    		{
    			"name": "Regular field title",
    			"value": "Some value here"
    		}
    	],
    	"footer": {
    		"text": "Some footer text here",
    		"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png"
    	}
    }

You can learn more about embeds in [Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord](https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds).

If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Discord credentials to `POST` to the following URL:

## Mention users and channels#

To mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to [Discord's message formatting guidelines](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting).

To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.

You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in [Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:

  * **User** : `<@USER_ID>`
  * **Channel** : `<#CHANNEL_ID>`
  * **Role** : `<@&ROLE_ID>`
