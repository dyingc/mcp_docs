# Google Calendar Calendar operations#

Use this operation to check availability in a calendar in Google Calendar. Refer to [Google Calendar](../) for more information on the Google Calendar node itself.

## Availability#

Use this operation to check if a time-slot is available in a calendar.

Enter these parameters:

  * **Credential to connect with** : Create or select an existing [Google Calendar credentials](../../../credentials/google/).
  * **Resource** : Select **Calendar**.
  * **Operation** : Select **Availability**.
  * **Calendar** : Choose a calendar you want to check against. Select **From list** to choose the title from the dropdown list or **By ID** to enter a calendar ID.
  * **Start Time** : The start time for the time-slot you want to check. By default, uses an expression evaluating to the current time (`{{ $now }}`).
  * **End Time** : The end time for the time-slot you want to check. By default, uses an expression evaluating to an hour from now (`{{ $now.plus(1, 'hour') }}`).

### Options#

  * **Output Format** : Select the format for the availability information:
    * **Availability** : Returns if there are already events overlapping with the given time slot or not.
    * **Booked Slots** : Returns the booked slots.
    * **RAW** : Returns the RAW data from the API.
  * **Timezone** : The timezone used in the response. By default, uses the n8n timezone.
