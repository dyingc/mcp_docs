# FTP#

The FTP node is useful to access and upload files to an FTP or SFTP server.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/ftp/).

To connect to an SFTP server, use an SFTP credential. Refer to [FTP credentials](../../credentials/ftp/) for more information.

## Operations#

  * **Delete** a file or folder
  * **Download** a file
  * **List** folder content
  * **Rename** or move a file or folder
  * **Upload** a file

Uploading files

To attach a file for upload, you'll need to use an extra node such as the [Read/Write Files from Disk](../n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node or the [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to pass the file as a data property.

## Delete#

This operation includes one parameter: **Path**. Enter the remote path that you would like to connect to.

### Delete options#

The delete operation adds one new option: **Folder**. If you turn this option on, the node can delete both folders and files. This configuration also displays one more option:

  * **Recursive** : If you turn this option on and you delete a folder or directory, the node will delete all files and directories within the target directory.

## Download#

Configure this operation with these parameters:

  * **Path** : Enter the remote path that you would like to connect to.
  * **Put Output File in Field** : Enter the name of the output binary field to put the file in.

## List#

Configure this operation with these parameters:

  * **Path** : Enter the remote path that you would like to connect to.
  * **Recursive** : Select whether to return an object representing all directories / objects recursively found within the FTP/SFTP server (turned on) or not (turned off).

## Rename#

Configure this operation with these parameters:

  * **Old Path** : Enter the existing path of the file you'd like to rename in this field.
  * **New Path** : Enter the new path for the renamed file in this field.

### Rename options#

This operation adds one new option: **Create Directories**. If you turn this option on, the node will recursively create the destination directory when renaming an existing file or folder.

## Upload#

Configure this operation with these parameters:

  * **Path** : Enter the remote path that you would like to connect to.
  * **Binary File** : Select whether you'll upload a binary file (turned on) or enter text content to be uploaded (turned off). Other parameters depend on your selection in this field.
    * **Input Binary Field** : Displayed if you turn on **Binary File**. Enter the name of the input binary field that contains the file you'll upload in this field.
    * **File Content** : Displayed if you turn off **Binary File** Enter the text content of the file you'll upload in this field.

Uploading files

To attach a file for upload, you'll need to use an extra node such as the [Read/Write Files from Disk](../n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node or the [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to pass the file as a data property.
