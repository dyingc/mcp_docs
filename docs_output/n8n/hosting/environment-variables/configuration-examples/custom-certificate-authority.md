# Configure n8n to use your own certificate authority or self-signed certificate#

You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.

Available in version 1.42.0

This feature is only available in version 1.42.0+.

To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to `/opt/custom-certificates` in the container.

## Docker#

The examples below assume you have a folder called `pki` that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.

### Docker CLI#

When using the CLI you can use the `-v` flag from the command line:
    
    
    1

| 
    
    
    docker run -it --rm \
     --name n8n \
     -p 5678:5678 \
     -v ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates \
     docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

    name: n8n
    services:
        n8n:
            volumes:
                - ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates
            container_name: n8n
            ports:
                - 5678:5678
            image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
      
  
---|---  
  
You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):
    
    
    1

| 
    
    
    docker exec --user 0 n8n chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/custom-certificates
