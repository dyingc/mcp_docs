# Timezone and localization environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

Variable | Type | Default | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` | * | `America/New_York` | The n8n instance timezone. Important for schedule nodes (such as Cron).  
`N8N_DEFAULT_LOCALE` | String | `en` | A locale identifier, compatible with the [Accept-Language header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language). n8n doesn't support regional identifiers, such as `de-AT`. When running in a locale other than the default, n8n displays UI strings in the selected locale, and falls back to `en` for any untranslated strings.
