# Executions environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

This page lists environment variables to configure workflow execution settings.

Variable | Type | Default | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`EXECUTIONS_MODE` | Enum string: `regular`, `queue` | `regular` | Whether executions should run directly or using queue.  
  
Refer to [Queue mode](../../../scaling/queue-mode/) for more details.  
`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` | Number | `-1` | Sets a default timeout (in seconds) to all workflows after which n8n stops their execution. Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX`. Set `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` to `-1` to disable.  
`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX` | Number | `3600` | The maximum execution time (in seconds) that users can set for an individual workflow.  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_ERROR` | Enum string: `all`, `none` | `all` | Whether n8n saves execution data on error.  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_SUCCESS` | Enum string: `all`, `none` | `all` | Whether n8n saves execution data on success.  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS` | Boolean | `false` | Whether to save progress for each node executed (true) or not (false).  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to save data of executions when started manually.  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` | Boolean | `true` | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis.  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` | Number | `336` | The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted.  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` | Number | `10000` | Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_HARD_DELETE_BUFFER` | Number | `1` | How old (hours) the finished execution data has to be to get hard-deleted. By default, this buffer excludes recent executions as the user may need them while building a workflow.  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_HARD_DELETE_INTERVAL` | Number | `15` | How often (minutes) execution data should be hard-deleted.  
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_SOFT_DELETE_INTERVAL` | Number | `60` | How often (minutes) execution data should be soft-deleted.  
`N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT` | Number | `-1` | Max production executions allowed to run concurrently, in both regular and scaling modes. `-1` to disable in regular mode.
