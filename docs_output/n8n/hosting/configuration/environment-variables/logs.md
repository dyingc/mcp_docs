# Logs environment variables#

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

This page lists environment variables to set up logging for debugging. Refer to [Logging in n8n](../../../logging-monitoring/logging/) for details.
