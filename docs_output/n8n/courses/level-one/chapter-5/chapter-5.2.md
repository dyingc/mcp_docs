# 2\. Inserting data into Airtable#

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to insert the data received from the HTTP Request node into Airtable using the [Airtable node](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/).

Spreadsheet nodes

You can replace the Airtable node with another spreadsheet app/service. For example, n8n also has a node for [**Google Sheets**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/).

After this step, your workflow should look like this:

## Configure your table#

If we're going to insert data into Airtable, we first need to set up a table there. To do this:

  1. [Create an Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup).
  2. In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, _beginner course_.

![Create an Airtable base](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-create-airtable-base.png)_Create an Airtable base_

  3. In the beginner course base, by default, you have a table called **Table 1** with four fields: `Name`, `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status`. These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our "orders" data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result. Prepare the table by doing the following:

     * Rename the table from **Table 1** to **orders** to make it easier to identify.
     * Delete the 3 blank records created by default.
     * Delete the `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status` fields.
     * Edit the `Name` field (the primary field) to read `orderID`, with the **Number** field type.
     * Add the rest of the fields, and their field types, using the table below as a reference:
Field name | Field type  
---|---  
`orderID` | Number  
`customerID` | Number  
`employeeName` | Single line text  
`orderPrice` | Number  
`orderStatus` | Single line text  

Now your table should look like this:

![Orders table in Airtable](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-orders-table.png)_Orders table in Airtable_

Now that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI.

## Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node#

Add an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node.

Remember

You can add a node connected to an existing node by selecting the **+** icon next to the existing node.

In the node panel:

  1. Search for Airtable.
  2. Select **Create a record** from the **Record Actions** search results.

This will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window.

In the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters:

  * **Credential to connect with** :
    * Select **Create new credential**.
    * Keep the default option **Connect using: Access Token** selected.
    * **Access token** : Follow the instructions from the [Airtable credential](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) page to create your token. Use the recommended scopes and add access to your beginners course base. Save the credential and close the Credential window when you're finished.
  * **Resource** : Record.
  * **Operation** : Create. This operation will create new records in the table.
  * **Base** : You can pick your base from a list (for example, beginner course).
  * **Table** : orders.
  * **Mapping Column Mode** : Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields must have the same as the columns in Airtable.

## Test the Airtable node#

Once you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting **Execute step**. This might take a moment to process, but you can follow the progress by viewing the base in Airtable.

Your results should look like this:

![Airtable node results](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-airtable-node.png)_Airtable node results_

All 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable:

![Imported records in the orders table](/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-airtable-records.png)_Imported records in the orders table_

## What's next?#

**Nathan 🙋** : Wow, this automation is already so useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable. Remember that I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table and calculate the price of booked orders?

**You 👩‍🔧** : Sure, no problem. As a next step, I'll use a new node to filter the orders based on their status.
